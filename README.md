# Terra Mortuum

Terra Mortuum  (Latin for  Land of Dead) is a single player first-person shooter for Android mobile devices that uses the Unity game engine to immerse the player into a post-apocalyptic world to face hordes of zombies in order to survive.

## Overview

In  Terra Mortuum , the player is caught in the middle of a zombie apocalypse. The player must survive waves of zombies for as long as possible by eliminating the zombies using nothing but an M9 pistol.

The player is surrounded in a barren wasteland. Their only option is to fight their way through the incoming wave of zombies. All the player has is their lifeline and an M9 pistol. The player must avoid to get too close to the zombies or they will end up like one of them. The longer the player survives, the higher the points.
